        <p class="muted"><strong>Methodology – Version 1.0</strong></p>
    </header>

    <h2>1. Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The Global CBDC Readiness Index (GCRI) is designed to measure the
        <strong>relative readiness, maturity, and adoption</strong> of central bank
        digital currencies (CBDCs) across selected economies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The index provides a <strong>structured, transparent, and repeatable framework</strong>
        to assess CBDC development beyond individual announcements or pilot headlines.
    </p>
    <p>
        The GCRI is a <strong>reference benchmark only</strong> and does not represent
        a financial instrument, investment product, or tradable asset.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Index Universe</h2>
    <p>
        The index universe consists of countries whose central banks meet at least one
        of the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A retail or wholesale CBDC has been launched</li>
        <li>An advanced pilot program is underway</li>
        <li>A formally approved CBDC roadmap has been published</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The initial universe is intentionally limited to ensure data quality and
        consistency. Expansion of the universe may occur in accordance with the
        governance rules outlined below.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</h2>

    <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
    <p>A country is eligible for inclusion if reliable public information confirms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Live CBDC issuance</li>
        <li>Government- or central bank-approved pilot deployment</li>
        <li>An official CBDC policy or implementation framework</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Index Factors and Weighting</h2>
    <p>
        Each country is evaluated across five core factors. Scores are assigned on a
        standardized scale and combined using fixed weights.
    </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Factor</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Weight</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>CBDC Status</td>
                <td>Stage of development (live, pilot, design)</td>
                <td>30%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Usage & Transaction Scale</td>
                <td>Observed or reported usage levels</td>
                <td>25%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Legal & Regulatory Framework</td>
                <td>Statutory and regulatory preparedness</td>
                <td>20%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cross-Border & Wholesale Integration</td>
                <td>Interbank and international settlement initiatives</td>
                <td>15%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Technical Infrastructure Readiness</td>
                <td>Platform maturity and operational capability</td>
                <td>10%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Total</th>
                <th></th>
                <th>100%</th>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>5. Scoring Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        Each factor is scored on a <strong>0–100 scale</strong> based on predefined,
        transparent criteria.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>90–100:</strong> Fully live and operational at scale</li>
        <li><strong>60–89:</strong> Advanced pilot or limited production use</li>
        <li><strong>30–59:</strong> Early-stage pilot or controlled testing</li>
        <li><strong>0–29:</strong> Research or conceptual phase</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Scores are derived solely from verifiable public disclosures and do not rely on
        projections or forecasts.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Index Calculation</h2>
    <p>
        Each country’s aggregate score is calculated as the weighted sum of its factor
        scores.
    </p>

    <div class="formula">
        Index Value = (Current Aggregate Score ÷ Base Aggregate Score) × Base Index Level
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Base Index Level:</strong> 1,000<br>
        <strong>Base Date:</strong> Index launch date
    </p>

    <h2>7. Rebalancing and Review</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The index is reviewed and updated on a <strong>quarterly basis</strong>.</li>
        <li>Rebalancing reflects changes in CBDC status, usage, or regulatory developments.</li>
        <li>Extraordinary updates occur only in the event of a full CBDC launch or termination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Sources</h2>
    <p>Primary sources include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Central bank publications and official statements</li>
        <li>Bank for International Settlements (BIS)</li>
        <li>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</li>
        <li>Government and regulatory documents</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Governance and Methodology Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This methodology is versioned and publicly available</li>
        <li>Material changes require advance disclosure</li>
        <li>Historical index values are maintained for continuity</li>
    </ul>
